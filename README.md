# Python-LinkedIn-Project

This program streamlines the process of applying to multiple EasyApply jobs on LinkedIn by web scraping using selenium. To ensure relevancy, it filters and applies to jobs that pertain to an individual's preferred industry.

## Future improvements:
- Work on accounting for easy apply searches opening in a separate tab (project only accounts for pop up screens)
